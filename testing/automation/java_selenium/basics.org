|-----------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Type | Size   | Description                                                    |
|-----------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
| byte      | 8-bit  | Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127                          |
| short     | 16-bit | Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767                    |
| int       | 32-bit | Stores whole numbers from -2^31 to 2^31                        |
| long      | 64-bit | Stores whole numbers from -2^63 to 2^63                        |
| float     | 32-bit | Stores fractions. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits |
| double    | 64-bit | Stores fractions. Sufficient for storing 15-16 decimal digits  |
| boolean   | 1 bit  | Stores true or false values                                    |
| char      | 16-bit | Sotes a single character/letter or ASCII values                |
